Building A Classification Model for Predicting Suspicious firms Using A Logistic Regression Model

India is the ‘Most Corrupt Country in Asia-Pacific Region’, according to a recent study by Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO working against corruption.
Study also shown that the prop for this corruption was mostly facilitated by some so-called firms.

Hence, the Measures to tackle corruption and curb the growing menace of suspicious firms has dominated the national discourse over the past years.

The Indian government endorsed for the Auditor Office to audit some relevant firms in different sectors.
The goal was to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors.

The dataset I'll be working is a Exhaustive one year non-confidential data in the year 2015 to 2016 of firms collected from the Auditor Office of India to be used in building a predictor for classifying suspicious firms.

In this project, I'll:

1. Prepare the data for machine learning

2. Train a model that can predict the fraudulent firm Using a Logistic Regression model

3. Measure the accuracy of the model
